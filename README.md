# Serial Device Controller - Arduino Project

This project allows you to control an LED, fan, and buzzer connected to an Arduino board using serial commands through the Serial Monitor.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Turn ON/OFF LED via serial commands
- Control a fan through serial
- Toggle buzzer using typed inputs
- Display current status in Serial Monitor

## ðŸ“¦ Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LED (with 220Î© resistor)
- DC Fan
- Piezo Buzzer
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply (USB or Battery)

## ðŸ“‹ Serial Commands
- `ledon` / `ledoff`
- `fanon` / `fanoff`
- `buzzeron` / `buzzeroff`

## ðŸ“· Images
You can include either:
- A Tinkercad circuit image
- OR real hardware photos

## ðŸ§  How to Use
1. Upload the code to Arduino using Arduino IDE
2. Open Serial Monitor (`9600 baud`)
3. Type commands like `ledon` and press Enter
